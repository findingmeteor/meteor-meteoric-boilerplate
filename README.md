# Yet another boilerplate for Meteor with Meteoric

This boilerplate is based on [dalequi/meteor-meteoric-boilerplate](https://github.com/dalequi/meteor-meteoric-boilerplate).

I made the following changes:

* Added autoforms to solve "AutoForm is not defined".
* Updated pacage versions
* Remove autopublish and insecure
* Use lib directory instead of both
* Filenames convention is consistent. Don't use camelcase
* Publications is a directory
* methods.js removed. I put them in server/methods
* security folder contains authentication, authorization and permissions

## include the following packages

* Autoforms, SimpleSchema,
meteor
